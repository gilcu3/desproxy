   <h1>Introduction: What is desproxy for?</h1>
   
   Desproxy is a TCP tunnel for HTTP proxies. 
   
   <p>HTTP proxies are network servers that are used to give HTTP (web) access
   to computers that are not connected to the Internet. This is a typical 
   scenario in corporate networks and recently in home networks too. HTTP
   proxies connect to the Internet either directly or via a 
   <i>parent proxy</i> (which in fact connects to the Internet directly or
   via another parent proxy, and so on...)
 
   <p>HTTP clients (web browsers) use HTTP proxies to request web pages; the
   HTTP server just forwards those request to the destination server. All the
   negotiation is done via the HTTP protocol, which is designed just to carry
   HTTP requests and no <i>generic</i> (TCP/IP) traffic. <b>That is why you 
   can't (normally) use Internet applications beside your web server if you
   are behind a HTTP proxy</b>.
   
   <p>That is what desproxy is good for. Desproxy is a TCP
   tunnel, which means desproxy can forward TCP/IP traffic via a 
   HTTP proxy. Desproxy uses a HTTP/1.1 method (CONNECT) to 
   establish TCP/IP connections on demand. CONNECT is used for 
   SSL connections when accessing to secure sites, so if you can access
   sites that support SSL (www.hotmail.com for example) you can use desproxy.
   
   <p>Note I recall TCP/IP traffic.
   
   <p>Not all IP (Internet) traffic is just TCP/IP. In fact there are two more
   protocols widely used in the Internet not supported by desproxy: UDP
   and ICMP:
   <ul>
    
    <li><p>ICMP is used to manage large IP networks. The only application
    using ICMP you may miss is <b>ping</b>.</li>
    
    <li><p>UDP is an unreliable connection-less fast transport protocol, mostly
    used in network games and other applications that need low latency network
    traffic. Notably <b>DNS</b> uses UDP packets for fast delivery.</li> 
   </ul>
   
   <h1>Will desproxy work with my HTTP proxy?</h1>
   
   Short answer: just give it a try<br>
   
   <p>Long answer: desproxy should work with every HTTP proxy, with the 
   following exceptions:
   <ul>
    <li><p><b>MS Proxies with NTLM authentication</b>. NTLM is a proprietary
    authentication method from Microsoft, not a standard authentication
    method. Maybe in the future desproxy will support NTLM authentication, but
    currently it doesn't.</li>
    
    <li><p><b>HTTP/1.0 Proxies</b>. Desproxy needs the CONNECT method, which
    is only available from HTTP/1.1 protocol version. It's very unlikely your
    proxy doesn't accept HTTP/1.1 requests.</li>
   
    <li><p><b>HTTP/1.1 Proxies without the CONNECT method</b>. Maybe your
    network administrator deactivated CONNECT support in the proxy, or maybe
    CONNECT is restricted to the HTTPS port (443).</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h1>Assumptions</h1>
   
   Let's assume the following:
   <ul>
    
    <li><p>your HTTP proxy host name is "proxy" and its address is
    "192.0.0.1"</li>
    
    <li><p>your HTTP proxy port is "8080"</li>
    
    <li><p>your HTTP proxy <b>doesn't need authentication</b>. It case
    you need HTTP authentication, please read <a href="#AUTH">this</a>.
   
    <li><p>your <b>system console</b> will be:
     <ul>
      <li><p><b>MS/DOS box</b> if you are running Windows 95, Windows 98,
      or Windows ME</li>
      <li><p><b>Windows NT command shell</b> if you are running Windows NT,
      Windows 2000 or Windows XP</li>
      <li><p>A <b>terminal</b> (xterm, the console or a virtual terminal) if
      you are running Linux, *BSD or other UN*X</li>
     </ul>
    </li> 
   </ul>
   
   <h1>About connections</h1>

   Imagine you need a network application that uses only one TCP/IP
   connection with just one server. That's the case of <b>IRC</b> in which you
   connect to an IRC server or <b>ssh</b> where you tipically connect just to
   one UNIX computer at a time. That's what I called a "static connection".

   <p>Of course that's not the case of a <b>web browser</b> or a <b>file
   sharing program</b>, both of them doing several connections at a time
   to different computers. That's what I call "dynamic connections".
   
   <h1>Static connections examples</h1>
   
   How to use desproxy to...
   
   <h2>...connect to IRC</h2>
   
   Suppose you want to connect to IRC using  <b>irc.undernet.org</b>
   port <b>6667</b> as your IRC server. First you have to start a system
   console (see <b>Assumptions</b> above for details) and type
   
   <p><pre><code>desproxy irc.undernet.org 6667 proxy 8080 1080</code></pre>
   
   <p>That should start desproxy, giving you the copyright notice along with
   some information. The following is a screen capture from desproxy 0.0.23

   <p><pre><code>-----------------------------------
desproxy                     0.0.23

This release brought to you patched
by Rutger Nijlunsig.

See RutgerWork.txt in documentation
for details about new features.

Great work guy!
-----------------------------------

TCP port 1080 Binded & Listening
Press ENTER to Quit</code></pre>

   <p>Desproxy reports it is listening in local port 1080 ready for a
   connection.
   
   <p>Open your favourite IRC client (install it first ;D) and connect to 
   127.0.0.1 port 1080 as your irc server (127.0.0.1 is a virtual IP, 
   always referencing to your local machine). Then, your IRC client should
   connect to desproxy. It looks like

   <p><pre><code>Connection request from 127.0.0.1, port 1220
Connecting to http proxy (proxy:8080)
Bidirectional connection established</pre></code>

   <p>Then you should be able to use your IRC client as if you were directly
   connected to irc.undernet.org.
   
   <h2>...log in a computer using ssh</h2>
   
   Suppose you have a shell account in a computer that supports secure
   connections via ssh. Let's assume it's called
   <b>shell.corporate.com</b>. SSH uses port number <b>22</b> by default. So
   start a new system console and type:
   <p><pre><code>desproxy shell.corporate.com 22 proxy 8080 1080</pre></code>
   
   <p>Then, tell your ssh client to connect to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 1080
   and you should get a ssh password prompt!
   
   <h2>...use other static clients</h2>
   
   Let's assume you want to use network application X, which doesn't support
   HTTP proxies but use one TCP/IP connection (like IRC and SSH). To make
   X work with desproxy, you just have to do the following:
   <ul>
    
    <li><p>Search for the default port of that application:
    <ul>
     
     <li><p>ftp: 21</li>

     <li><p>ssh: 22</li>
     
     <li><p>telnet: 23</li>
     
     <li><p>smtp: 25</li>
     
     <li><p>...</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><p>Search for the default server of that application (if there is one)
    <ul>
     
     <li><p>AIM: toc.oscar.aol.com (port 21)</li>
     
     <li><p>ICQ: icq.mirabilis.com (port 4000)</li>
     
     <li><p>Yahoo messenger: cs.yahoo.com (port 5050)</li>
     
     <li><P>MSN Messenger: messenger.hotmail.com (port 1863)</li>
     
     <li><p>...</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><p>Start desproxy, passing that info as command line parameters. The
    format is
    <p><code><pre>desproxy remote_host remote_port proxy_host proxy_port local_port</pre></code>
    
    <p>Just give a local_port of your desire, but always over 1023, cause
    lower ports may need administrator privileges.
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
   </ul>
   
   <h1>Using desproxy with dynamic connections</h1>
   
   You can see that for every application that needs to be
   un-proxyzed you have to start a desproxy program. That is OK if you
   are using irc, ssh or other application that always connects to the
   same server. But if you need to dynamically establish TCP connections
   it's impossible to follow that path.
   
   <p>That's why I wrote desproxy-socks5server. Desproxy-socks5server is
   just a desproxy implementation of a Socks 5 Server. A Socks 5 Server is
   like a "TCP proxy": you just request a TCP connection and the Socks 5
   Server does the work for you.
   
   <p>Of course, client applications need to have support for Socks 5 Server.
   If your application lacks Socks 5 support, you can use
   desproxy-socks4server instead, given it has Socks 4 support.
   
   <p><b>If the application lacks any Socks support, and needs dynamic
   connections, you can't do anything: it won't work behind the HTTP
   proxy</b>.
   
   <p>Using desproxy-socksXserver (X being 4 or 5) is very easy: you only
   have to start a system console and type:
   
   <p><code><pre>desproxy-socks4server proxy 8080 1080</pre></code>

   <p>or

   <p><code><pre>desproxy-socks5server proxy 8080 1080</pre></code>
   
   <p>Here I'm assuming "proxy" and "8080" to be your proxy name and port.
   
   <p>That should start the Socks server. Then you have to tell your
   application to use Socks server "127.0.0.1" port "1080". Just see in the
   proxy configuration and look for "Socks Server" adjustments.
   
   <p>That is not all, unfortunately. Beside having your Socks server up you
   need <b>DNS</b> access. Of course if you don't have DNS access, you just
   have to use desproxy-dns.
   So let's see the two scenarios
   
   <h1>DNS for dynamic connections</h1>
   
   <h2>Direct DNS access</h2>
   
   If you have direct DNS access then you don't need to do anything else.
   You know you have direct DNS access if you can resolve host names to
   IP addresses. To test DNS just start a system console and type
   
   <p><code><pre>ping www.hotmail.com</pre></code>
   
   <p>Of course, you can't ping anything outside the proxy, but ping should
   display the IP address of hotmail, if it can resolve it. Ping should
   display something like
   
   <p><code><pre>Pinging www.hotmail.com [64.4.43.7] with 32 bytes of data</pre></code>
   
   <p>if you are using MS Windows, or
   
   <p><code><pre>PING www.hotmail.com (64.4.43.7): 56 data bytes</pre></code>

   <p>if you are running Linux, *BSD or UN*X.

   <p>Ping should also complain about losing all the packets. OK, that's as it
   should be. If ping displays "unknown host www.hotmail.com" try a different
   one, like "www.yahoo.com" or "www.sun.com". It that three displayed "unknown
   host" then you don't have DNS access.
   
   <h2>No DNS access</h2>
   
   If you don't have DNS access you have to do two things:
   <ul>
   
   <li><p>Search for a public accessible DNS server IP address
    
    <p>Let's assume you find one (195.196.180.14).
   </li>
   
   <li><p>Start desproxy-dns
    <p>Open another system console and type
    
    <p><code><pre>desproxy-dns 195.196.180.14 proxy 8080</pre></code>
   </li>
   </ul>
   <p>After that you will have a DNS server running in your computer.
   
   <p><b>NOTE</b>: as desproxy-dns listens in port 53 (which is less than 1024)
   you may need administrator privileges to exec desproxy-dns (in fact if you
   are running UN*X, you actually have to run desproxy-dns as <b>root</b>).
   
   <p>OK, so you have a dns server accessible now. But your computer doesn't
   know anything about that. You must configure your network accordingly
   (again, need to be root in UN*X).
   
   <p>In <b>Windows</b> just go to Control Panel-&gt
   Network-&gt TCP/IP -&gt Network Adapter-&gt Properties-&gt DNS
   Configuration. Select "Activate DNS" and add "127.0.0.1" as a DNS server.
   Then restart. Test the ping again. Works? OK!
   
   <p>In <b>UN*X</b> just edit /etc/resolv.conf and add the line
   "nameserver 127.0.0.1". You don't have to restart anything. Just test
   ping and see if it works.

   How to use desproxy to...

   <h2>...instant message anyone</h2>

   Just remember to get a DNS server (directly or using desproxy-dns)
   see above. Then, start a socks4server
   
   <p><code><pre>desproxy-socks4server proxy 8080 1080</pre></code>
   
   <p>You could start desproxy-socks5server, but some applications refuse
   to work with Socks 5 (MS Internet Explorer for example) and the
   Socks 4 Version is faster.

   <p>Remember to leave blank the username and password fields in the client
   Socks configuration: desproxy does all the work, in case your HTTP proxy
   needs authentication. 
   
   <p>Get your favourite Instant Messaging program and configure
   it to use Socks 5 Server "127.0.0.1" port "1080". Then, log in and have fun!

   <h2>...share files</h2>

   Again, the same applies for DNS. Remember to start a desproxy-socks4server,
   configure your program and go!

   <a name="AUTH"></a><h1>About HTTP Authentication</h1>

   Some HTTP proxies need for security reasons a method of checking client's
   identity. That's called HTTP authentication (or HTTP authorization).

   <p>Despoxy now supports Basic HTTP authentication. If your proxy needs other
   kind of authentication (either Digest or NTLM) desproxy won't work.

   <p>For desproxy to work with a HTTP proxy that needs authentication, you
   have to tell desproxy which username and password to use. Desproxy reads
   the environment variable PROXY_USER to get that info.

   <p>Suppose your proxy username is "mayka" and your proxy password is
   "007sgotLTK". Then, before using any of the desproxy programs you
   should type:

   <p><pre><code>set PROXY_USER=mayka:007sgotLTK</code></pre>

   <p>in your system console.
   
   <p>Beware passwords can include some characters that should be
   escaped from the system console. For example, if your password is
   "moon!=sun", and you are running Linux, you should type

   <p><pre><code>export PROXY_USER=yourusername:moon\!\=sun</code></pre>

   <p>Note characters "!" and "=" are escaped using the backslash "\".
   If you are running MS Windows, as long as I know, you don't have to
   escape any valid password character.

   <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

   A normal <b>desproxy</b> session looks like this:
   
   <p><pre><code>miguel@Kosmos3000$ desproxy 127.0.0.1 21 127.0.0.1 4480 2222

-----------------------------------
desproxy                      0.0.8

HTTP/1.1
(c) Miguelanxo Otero Salgueiro 2001
-----------------------------------

Listening on port 2222
Connection request from 127.0.0.1, port 1227
Connecting to http proxy (127.0.0.1:4480)
Bidirectional connection stablished
(127.0.0.1:21) &lt;-&gt; (localhost)
End of connection.</code></pre>

   <p>Here, I connected to my local ftp server (127.0.0.1:21)
   using my local proxy (127.0.0.1:4480). You can see how, after the
   connection is accepted, desproxy connected to the proxy, interchanged
   some bytes  (a FTP session) and terminates the connection.
   
   <p>Desproxy is quite self explanatory about errors. Desproxy-inetd is
   far more obscure, because the way inetd uses it (can't print error
   messages) to the console.
   
   <p>Basically there are two kind of errors:              
   <ul>
    
    <li><p><b>Errors reported when connecting to the proxy</b>: the http
 page showing the error is displayed.</li>
               
    <li><p><b>Every other error</b>: a short error message is displayed.</li>
   </ul>
   Errors reported by proxy may be the worse... <br>
   
   <h2>Some common HTTP errors (as reported by the proxy)</h2>
               
   <ul>
    
    <li><p><b>HTTP 400 Bad Request</b> - Some versions of desproxy
    (0.0.21) cause this error (FATAL)</li>
    
    <li><p><b>HTTP 403 Forbidden</b> - Forbidden to do that (FATAL)</li>
    
    <li><p><b>HTTP 404 Not Found</b> - Page not found, or resource 
    not found (MINOR)</li>
    
    <li><p><b>HTTP 405 Method not Allowed</b> - Can't do CONNECT method
    (FATAL)</li>
    
    <li><p><b>HTTP 500 Internal Server Error</b> - Maybe you're trying
     to connect to a remote closed port (remote site reported connection
     refused) (MINOR)</li>
    
    <li><p><b>HTTP 503 Service Unavailable</b> -&gt; The proxy can't
    reach the site (MINOR)</li>
    
    <li><p><b>HTTP 505 HTTP Version Not Supported</b> - CONNECT method
    not available (FATAL)</li>
    
    <li><p><b>HTTP 502 Bad Gateway</b> - Stands for "DNS lookup error"
    (MINOR)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>(FATAL) - Forget about using "desproxy", you can't surpass the proxy.<br>
   (TODO) - To do, not yet implemented.<br>
   (MINOR) - Temporary fault or maybe YOUR fault!.<br>
