0.1.0-pre3 (10/06/2004) - Patched desproxy-dns.c, the UDP short write bug
			  should be ironed out.

			- Added changes suggested by Dag Wieers
			  <dag@wieers.com> to install script and Makefile.in
			  
			- Removed non-working desproxy-test.
			
			- Removed i18n obsolete po dir. Desproxy lacks locale
			  support by now.
			 
0.1.0-pre2		- Important fixes:

			  - BUFFER OVERFLOWS (formely BUFFER OVERRUN's)
			    doesn't take desproxy down.
			  - desproxy-socksserver joins the two previous
			    socks servers (versions 4 and 5) and 
			    incorporates some bug fixes.
			  - all the applications terminate only after error
			    or pressing <Control+C>, because waiting for
			    ENTER as before prevented from running
			    in non-terminals (background).
			  - The source code compiles without modification
			    in:
			    
			      - Linux (tested debian 2.2 and 3.0)
			      - MacOS X (tested MacOS X 10.2 SERVER Edition)
			      - SunOS (tested SunOS 5.8)

			- Removed i18n obsolete messages in po/ 
			  (make install will fail when trying to install
			  mo files)
			    
0.1.0-pre1              - Changelog lost.

0.0.22	(01/23/2002)	- Just renamed 0.0.22a3 and released 0.0.22.

0.0.22a3 (01/19/2002)	- Alpha version again. This time HTTP 400 bug
			  (lacking HOST header bug) should be fixed.
			  Added User-Agent header.

0.0.22a2 (01/14/2002)	- Alpha version, release2. Only released to people
			  who requested, tries to work using MS & IBM proxies
			  (strict HTTP/1.1 headers, including HOST).
			  Documentation goes html.

0.0.21 (01/08/2002)     - Fixed that silly bug that make socks5server stop
                          working...

			- Added desproxy-socks4server, a socks v4 server,
			  useful if you have clients that don't support the
			  later socks 5 version (i.e. MS Internet Explorer &
			  friends... :D)

0.0.20 (12/17/2001)     - Another unstable release. Just added windows port and
			  fix write() bug.

0.0.19 (11/21/2001)	- THIS IS AN UNSTABLE RELEASE!!
			  This release is out to free me from answer many mails
			  requesting desproxy-socks5server to be released. So
			  this is out!
			  NEWS from 0.0.10:
			  
			  - Added desproxy-dns, a dns forwarder
			  - Added desproxy-socks5server, a socks5server
			    using desproxy, and able to use HTTP proxies as
			    parent proxies.
			  - Added socket2socket, a tiny application to connect
			    2 sockets (useful? -> yes, for me).

			  Many code cleaned (but some code dirtier :P than
			  0.0.10 release).

0.0.10 (10/11/2001)	- Now desproxy supports multiple connections
			  (leaving request_socket open for new connections)
			  It can be now used to connect to web sites using
			  multiple client connections. Thanks to Kandy for
			  the suggestion.
